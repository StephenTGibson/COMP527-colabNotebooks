Contains code from my MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liverpool, Sept 2021 - Sept 2022.

Includes code I wrote for my MSc Project as part of the [Scientific Computing Lab](https://github.com/SciCoLab), developing *physics informed* neural networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations.
